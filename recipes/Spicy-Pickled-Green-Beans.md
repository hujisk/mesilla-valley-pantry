# Spicy Pickled Green Beans

*These crisp, tangy beans are a favorite in my pantry. They have just enough heat to warm you up on a cold day and are wonderful alongside a slice of cornbread or chopped into a salad.*

## Ingredients
- 2 pounds fresh green beans, trimmed
- 4–6 small dried red chilies (such as arbol or pequín)
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced
- 2 teaspoons dill seed (or 4–5 sprigs fresh dill)
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon mustard seed
- 2½ cups white vinegar (5% acidity)
- 2½ cups water
- ¼ cup pickling salt (do not use iodized salt)

## Equipment
- Pint‑size canning jars, lids, and bands
- Water‑bath canner or large pot with rack
- Jar lifter, funnel, bubble remover
- Clean towels

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the beans:** Wash the beans and trim off the stem ends. Leave them whole, but if they are longer than your jars, cut them to fit with about ½ inch of headspace.

2. **Pack the jars:** Divide the dried chilies, garlic slices, dill seed, peppercorns, and mustard seed evenly among the clean, hot pint jars. Pack the beans upright into the jars, fitting them snugly but without crushing.

3. **Make the brine:** In a non‑reactive saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, and pickling salt. Bring to a full boil, stirring to dissolve the salt.

4. **Fill the jars:** Pour the boiling brine over the beans, leaving ½ inch of headspace. Run a bubble remover or a clean knife around the inside of the jar to release any air pockets. Wipe the rims with a damp, clean cloth.

5. **Seal and process:** Place lids and bands on the jars, tightening the bands fingertip‑tight. Lower the jars into your canner, ensuring they are covered by at least 1 inch of water. Bring to a full boil and process for 10 minutes (adjust for altitude as needed).

6. **Cool and store:** After processing, turn off the heat and let the jars sit in the canner for 5 minutes. Remove the jars with a jar lifter and set them on a towel‑lined counter, out of drafts. Let them cool completely (12–24 hours). Check that each lid has sealed (it should not flex when pressed). Store in a cool, dark place.

## Notes
- *Altitude adjustment:* Increase processing time by 1 minute for every 1,000 feet above sea level.
- The beans will be ready to eat after about 4 weeks, when the flavors have fully developed.
- If you prefer less heat, reduce the number of dried chilies or remove the seeds before adding.
- These pickles keep well for a year or more, but they rarely last that long!

*A little spice makes the pantry nice.*
