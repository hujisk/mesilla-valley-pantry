# Heirloom Tomatoes – Whole, Canned

*This is the way my grandmother put up tomatoes, and it’s the way I still do. The flavor of summer captured in a jar.*

## Ingredients
- 10–12 pounds ripe heirloom tomatoes (any variety you’ve grown)
- Bottled lemon juice or citric acid (for safe acidity)
- Canning salt (optional)
- Fresh basil leaves (optional, 1 per jar)

## Equipment
- Canning jars (quart or pint size), lids, and bands
- Water‑bath canner or a large, deep pot with a rack
- Jar lifter, funnel, and bubble remover
- Clean towels

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the tomatoes:** Wash the tomatoes thoroughly. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Fill another bowl with ice water. Score a small “X” on the bottom of each tomato. Drop the tomatoes into the boiling water for 30–60 seconds, just until the skins start to loosen. Transfer them immediately to the ice‑water bath. The skins should slip right off.

2. **Pack the jars:** Remove the cores and any blemishes. Leave the tomatoes whole or cut them into halves if they are very large. Pack the tomatoes into clean, hot jars, leaving ½ inch of headspace. If using basil, tuck a leaf into each jar.

3. **Add acid and salt:** To each quart jar add 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice (or ½ teaspoon citric acid). For pints, use 1 tablespoon lemon juice (or ¼ teaspoon citric acid). Add ½ teaspoon canning salt per quart if desired (¼ teaspoon per pint).

4. **Fill with boiling water:** Pour fresh boiling water over the tomatoes, maintaining the ½‑inch headspace. Run a bubble remover or a clean knife around the inside of the jar to release any trapped air. Wipe the rims with a damp, clean cloth.

5. **Seal and process:** Place lids and bands on the jars, tightening the bands fingertip‑tight. Lower the jars into your canner, ensuring they are covered by at least 1 inch of water. Bring to a full boil and process quarts for 45 minutes, pints for 40 minutes (adjust for altitude as needed).

6. **Cool and store:** After processing, turn off the heat and let the jars sit in the canner for 5 minutes. Remove the jars with a jar lifter and set them on a towel‑lined counter, out of drafts. Let them cool completely (12–24 hours). Check that each lid has sealed (it should not flex when pressed). Store in a cool, dark place.

## Notes
- *Altitude adjustment:* Increase processing time by 5 minutes for every 1,000 feet above sea level.
- These tomatoes are perfect for soups, stews, and sauces all winter long.
- If a jar does not seal, you can refrigerate it and use within a few days, or reprocess with a new lid.

*Put up with care, enjoy with gratitude.*
