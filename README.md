# The Mesilla Valley Homesteader's Pantry

Howdy, neighbors! I'm a homesteader here in the Mesilla Valley, and like many of you, I've spent years putting up food for the long winters. There's a special satisfaction in seeing a pantry full of jars you've put up yourself—tomatoes, pickles, jams, and all manner of preserves.

This here book is meant to gather our community's canning wisdom. I've started with a couple of my own recipes, but I hope you'll add yours too. Together we can create a lasting record of how we feed our families from the land.

## How to Contribute

If you have a favorite canning recipe, please share it! You can submit your recipe by creating a new file in the `recipes` folder. Follow the format of the existing recipes, and be sure to include:

- A clear list of ingredients
- Step‑by‑step instructions
- Any special notes about timing, sealing, or storage

If you're not comfortable with the “filing‑cabinet” system (they call it Git), you can also use the “Recipe Submission Template” issue to post your recipe, and I'll see about adding it to the book proper.

Let's keep our valley's traditions alive, one jar at a time.
